# Scientific Visualisation

## Description
In this repository, you will find our submission to the Scivis Contest of 2023. In particular, this yearâ€™s contest deals with the simulation of activity within the human brain, especially the changes within its network structure.

## How to run
To run the code and produce our animation, it is neccesary to have Python installed with all the modules specified in the requirements.txt file.
The argument `show_nodes` can be set to True/False to visualize the corresponding nodes or the different areas.
