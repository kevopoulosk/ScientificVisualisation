# Scientific Visualisation

## Description
In this repository, you will find our submission to the Scivis Contest of 2023. In particular, this yearâ€™s contest deals with the simulation of activity within the human brain, especially the changes within its network structure.

## How to run
To run the code and produce our animation, it is neccesary to have Python installed with all the modules specified in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Then, by typping into your predefined terminal the command `python project_vtk.py` you would be able to run the file. The behaviour of the program can be modified by setting the `show_nodes` to True/False to visualize the corresponding nodes or the different areas. To do so, you should modify the value inside the main function call in the script:
- `if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(True)  # Set to True or False as needed`

In order to visualise the lineplots presented in the report, you just need to run the file: `SciVis_brainplasticity.py`.
